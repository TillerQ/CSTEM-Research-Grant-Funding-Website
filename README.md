CSTEM Scholars provides funding support for students engaged in faculty-mentored research or creative experience. The program is funded by donors to the CSTEM Student-Faculty Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities Fund, with the goal to provide research support across all majors in CSTEM.
The program seeks to aid students in the process of designing, implementing, analyzing, and presenting
original and faculty-mentored research in order to build scholarly bodies of work.
This includes the ability to attend a professional conference before students are ready to present their own work.
